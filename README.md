#  Fantasy Football (CLI-Based)

The **Football Application** is a proposed terminal-based application designed to help football lovers efficiently manage players, matches, and teams through a structured command-line interface. The system will be built using Python, leveraging SQLAlchemy ORM for database operations and Rich for an enhanced CLI experience.
